Dataset: Use a smaller, standard dataset like CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100 (available in torchvision.datasets).

10 or 100 classes, tiny images (32x32) easy to handle.

Step 1: CNN Feature Extractor

Load a pretrained ResNet18 or a simpler CNN.

Remove the last classification layer, get feature vectors (e.g. 512-dim).

Freeze CNN weights (no fine-tuning) to keep it simple.

Step 2: Extract Features

Run all dataset images through CNN extractor, save the feature vectors and labels.

Step 3: Train Classical ML Models

Use scikit-learnâ€™s Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, etc. on the extracted CNN features.

Train and validate their accuracy.

Step 4: Ensemble

Combine classical ML predictions with deep learning model predictions (for example, the CNN with a small FC layer).

Use voting, stacking, or weighted averaging for the final prediction.

Bonus:

Add some simple augmentation in CNN training or classical ML tuning to boost performance.

Visualize feature embeddings using t-SNE or PCA.
